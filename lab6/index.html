<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays & Objects - Kiyo & Ramola</h1>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>

<p>Would anyone like to tell me what is going on? I am delirious with the flu and can barely type (this took me multiple editing sessions to make legible) and JavaScript is breaking my brain. Challenges? What wasn't a challenge. I think I might be having an aneurism (hyperbole) over this stuff. Btw if I type without doing back to edit for clarity it sdoufwlf wlook likewr thisf! :D Ramola is sick, I am sick. We are both sick out of our minds and between the two of us I think she took the brain cell so I tried my best, and I failed. Wes, Leslie, please re-explain JS to me so I can pass this class and walk away feeling like I learned something substantial.</p>

<h2>Lab Results/Information</h2>
<p>Restate: I did not get it to work, so... Nah.</p>
