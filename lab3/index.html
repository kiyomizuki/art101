<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>

<p>This lab was difficult for me because I still feel a though I am getting used to going everything in html and css confuses me, however, I am glad that I am getting to know things a little better with each assignment and help from my lab partner (Ramola) and Leslie as well in section. It is slowly but surely getting easier to do. I hope it's okay that I made literally everything purple iirc.</p>

<h1>Task 1: Have that repo duped</h1>
