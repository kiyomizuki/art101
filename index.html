 		<h2 style="color:#4D1C62;">Hi, I'm Gay and so is Takashi Shirogane</h2>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'" style="color:#4D1C62;">Hi there my name is Kiyo and I am a Chinese-American 20-year-old UCSC college student who doesn't know what the bloody fuck they're doing at any given moment. I am currently undeclared and affiliated with Porter Collge. What goes in an introduction? I like anime. I like games. I have no mental health points left and every day is a challenge to my ability continue living. For legal reasons this is a JOKE. It's joke, okay? Okay. K thanks. I have a therapist. Not a great one, but she is real. Please don't send me to CAPS. Thanks so much lol. I went there once and it was the most awkward and unhelpful experience of my life. If anyone knows where the health center is though, that'd be nice to know, my skills are art and writing, location and a sense of it? I have none. But I do need to get stabbed with my medication to continue living so lmfao xD</p>
